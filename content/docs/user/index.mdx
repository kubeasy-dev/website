title: Welcome to Kubeasy
description: Learn Kubernetes through interactive, real-world challenges. Kubeasy runs locally, validates your solutions automatically, and helps you level up your skills.

**Kubeasy** is an interactive learning platform that helps developers truly understand Kubernetes — by solving real problems.

Each challenge drops you into a minimal but realistic situation: maybe a Pod won’t start, a NetworkPolicy is too strict, or RBAC is silently blocking access. Your goal? Investigate, fix, and validate — using real tools like `kubectl`, not a browser playground.

## Learn by doing

Kubeasy isn’t about passively reading docs or watching videos. It’s about debugging, testing hypotheses, failing — and learning deeply by fixing things yourself.

You’ll face challenges like:

- Pods that crash due to bad resource limits
- Deployments that stay stuck in `Pending`
- Services that don’t expose anything
- Jobs that fail silently because of missing volumes

Each one mirrors a real-world issue you might face in production.

## A minimalist but strict approach

Every challenge gives you:

- A realistic problem (e.g. misconfigured pod, broken RBAC, network policy bug)
- A minimal initial setup
- A clear objective to reach
- An automated validation system

There’s no walkthrough. You’re on your own — but in a safe environment.

## Local environment

Kubeasy runs entirely on your machine using a lightweight Kind cluster. Each challenge is fully isolated:

- Runs locally with no cloud required
- Each challenge has its own namespace
- Everything runs through the Kubeasy CLI — no extra setup required
- Use your favorite tools — kubectl, Lens, or anything you’re comfortable with

You stay in control, and nothing touches your system outside the challenge scope.

## Who is it for?

Kubeasy is for:

- **Developers** who want to stop blindly copying manifests
- **DevOps engineers** looking to sharpen their cluster debugging skills
- **Learners** who want a practical, challenge-based way to understand Kubernetes

Whether you’re a beginner or already comfortable with `kubectl`, you’ll find challenges that teach you something new — by doing.

## Ready to start?

You’ll need Docker, Node.js and a terminal. That’s it.

Go to the [Getting Started guide](/docs/user/getting-started) to set up your environment in less than 5 minutes — and begin your first challenge.
