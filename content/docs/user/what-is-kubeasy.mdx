title: What’s Kubeasy
description: Kubeasy is an open-source learning platform that makes Kubernetes more accessible to developers through interactive challenges and local environments.

Kubernetes has become a cornerstone of modern infrastructure — powering everything from startups to the world’s largest tech companies. Its flexibility, extensibility, and vibrant ecosystem make it the **default orchestration layer** across the industry. But with that power comes complexity — and a steep learning curve, especially for developers.

Knowing how Kubernetes works isn’t just for SREs anymore. It's a career booster, a differentiator on a CV, and a valuable skill for developers who want to build resilient, production-ready software. And in a world where AI is writing more and more code, **your value comes from understanding systems — not just syntax**.

**Kubeasy was born out of both frustration — and a clear need.**

As a platform engineer, I’ve spent years working with Kubernetes in production. And while Kubernetes is a powerful, flexible system — designed for both **developers and operators** — in practice, it has been mostly handed off to Ops teams.

**That’s a problem.**

## Devs run the code — but don’t own the platform

Despite the fact that developers are writing the applications that run in Kubernetes, they’re often left out of the loop when it comes to understanding how the platform works. They’re told to “just deploy the manifest” — without context, visibility, or real feedback.

But Kubernetes was never meant to be that opaque. It was designed as a platform that offers clear, **structured primitives to be consumed by developers**. That’s powerful — but only if we give developers the knowledge and confidence to use those interfaces effectively.

Kubeasy is built to help bridge that gap — by giving developers the **skills and confidence** to operate Kubernetes themselves. Not to turn them into SREs, but to empower them to troubleshoot, understand what’s running, and handle level-one operations independently.

## Learning by doing — not just reading

Kubernetes has excellent documentation. But most of the real learning happens when something breaks.

And that’s where developers often struggle:

- Tutorials are too guided
- Examples are too perfect
- There's no room for mistakes, exploration, or discovery

**I’ve lived those gaps myself.**

I’ve debugged stuck Deployments, missing RBAC, broken Services — often just with a Teams chat : "It's not working, can you help me?"

I’ve helped dev teams understand why their Pods weren’t starting, or why their app was unreachable — and I always wished there was a better way to **build intuition**.

That’s why Kubeasy exists. It puts you directly in those situations — safely and locally — and challenges you to fix them, just like you would in real life.

## How it works

Kubeasy automatically sets up a **local Kubernetes cluster** (using [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)) on your machine.  
You don’t need to configure anything — the CLI handles it for you.

Within this cluster, each challenge is run in a **dedicated, isolated namespace**, fully separated from the rest. You're free to explore, break, fix, and retry without risk.

As the user, you have **full access** within the cluster: You can use `kubectl`, your favorite dashboard (like Lens), or any debugging tool — just like you would in a real environment.

Each challenge provides:

- A realistic broken setup
- A namespace containing only the necessary resources
- A clear objective (e.g. restore connectivity, fix RBAC, get a pod to start)
- Strict, automated validation of your fix

There are no scripts, no walkthroughs.

Just a clean environment, a real problem — and you, figuring it out.

## Why open source?

Kubeasy is open source because **transparency and community** matter.

Making the platform public allows:

- Developers and SREs to audit how validation works
- Experts to contribute new challenges
- Educators to create custom tracks for their teams
- Feedback loops that continuously improve the experience

Open source makes the project better — and keeps it aligned with what developers actually need.
