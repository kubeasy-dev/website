title: Your Kubernetes Journey
description: Track your progress across challenges with a clear learning path. Visualize what you’ve done, what’s next, and how far you’ve come.

Kubeasy provides a personalized **learning path** — a visual representation of your Kubernetes progress, designed to keep you motivated and focused.

Whether you're just starting or returning after a break, the **Kubernetes Journey** page helps you understand exactly where you are, what’s left to learn, and what you've already accomplished.

## Access your journey

You can access your **Kubernetes Journey** in two ways:

- From the [`/challenges`](/challenges) page by clicking the **“My Kubernetes Journey”** button
- From the top bar dropdown menu, under **“My Journey”**

## A Kanban-style view of your progress

The page is structured as a **Kanban board** with three columns:

- **To Do** — Challenges you haven’t started yet
- **In Progress** — The challenge you’re currently working on
- **Done** — Completed challenges, with a quick view of what you’ve solved

Each card gives you:

- The title and description of the challenge
- Its estimated time to complete
- Its main theme (e.g. RBAC, networking, monitoring)

You can switch between **Board view** and **Table view** depending on your preference.

## Track your learning at a glance

This summary helps you manage your learning, identify gaps, and celebrate your progress.

- **Challenges completed** — With a completion rate and visual progress bar
- **Last challenge started** — To help you resume where you left off
- **Last challenge completed** — Including when it was completed and a quick “Review” button

This summary helps you stay in control of your learning, identify what’s missing, and celebrate your progress.

## Build skills over time

The Journey page is more than just a tracker — it’s a **tool for reflection**. It shows your growth, your preferred themes, and the time you’ve invested in learning Kubernetes deeply.

- Want to challenge yourself? Try tackling themes you haven’t explored yet.
- Need a quick win? Filter by duration and choose a 10-minute scenario.

- XP and leveling system based on challenge difficulty
- Filtering by theme or skill
- Personalized recommendations based on your past challenges
