title: Kubeasy CLI Reference
description: Full reference of all available Kubeasy CLI commands to manage your challenges, cluster, and configuration.
---

The `kubeasy-cli` is the main tool to interact with Kubeasy locally: start challenges, submit solutions, reset environments, and more.

You can install it globally with:

```bash
npm install -g kubeasy-cli
```

## 🔐 Authentication

### `kubeasy-cli login`

Authenticate the CLI by pasting your personal API token (generated from the [profile page](/profile)).  
Your token is stored locally to allow secure access to challenge data and submission features.

## ⚙️ Setup

### `kubeasy-cli setup`

Prepare your local environment for Kubeasy. This command:

- Creates a local Kind cluster (if one doesn't exist)
- Installs the required components (validators, policies, etc.)

Usually run once per machine before starting challenges.

## 🧩 Challenge management

All challenge-related actions are available under the `challenge` subcommand.

### `kubeasy-cli challenge start <challenge>`

Start a challenge. This command:

- Applies the initial manifests into a new dedicated namespace
- Switches your `kubectl` context to that namespace
- Prepares everything to begin solving the problem

### `kubeasy-cli challenge submit <challenge>`

Submit your solution for validation.

- Runs all defined static and dynamic checks
- Uploads the results to the Kubeasy platform
- You can then review validation results and feedback via the web interface

### `kubeasy-cli challenge get <challenge>`

View details about a specific challenge, such as:

- Description
- Objective
- Estimated time
- Theme or category

### `kubeasy-cli challenge reset <challenge>`

Reset the challenge environment by reapplying the initial manifests. This is will also reset your progress and delete your submission on the platform.
Use this if you're stuck or want to start fresh.

### `kubeasy-cli challenge clean <challenge>`

Clean up all Kubernetes resources related to the challenge, including its namespace.  
This does **not** affect your challenge progress on the platform.

## 🧠 Shell autocompletion

### `kubeasy-cli completion`

Generate completion scripts for your shell:

- Bash
- Zsh
- Fish
- PowerShell

Example:

```bash
kubeasy-cli completion bash | tee -a ~/.bashrc
```

Or for zsh:

```bash
kubeasy-cli completion zsh | tee -a ~/.zshrc
```
